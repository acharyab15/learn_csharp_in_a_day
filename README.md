The CSProject contains a simple PaySlip Console application which calculates the pay for the staff (from a staff list provided as a file). It includes certain applications of inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation and reading/writing from/to files. It has a LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) to generate a summary about the staff.
